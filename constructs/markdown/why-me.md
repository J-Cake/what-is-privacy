# Why is it important to me

As a programmer, I spend a lot of time interacting with computers and other computer users, this not only leaves me plenty of time to open vulnerabilities into my own world, but everything I have worked on and every idea I've ever tested. Not only am I closely connected with computational systems, I take interest in designing them and their communications networks. A major part in systems design is knowing how to properly secure them. Also interesting but not my main interest is the study of their vulnerabilities. Careers exist around exploiting weaknesses and are some of the most high-paying professions in the computing industry^[6]^. It is this as well as many other reasons that personal privacy on the internet must remain one of my top priorities.
